# Changelog

feets uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/): MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.
A new feature bumps MINOR, a fix bumps PATCH, and a change that breaks
existing data or setups bumps MAJOR. The version shows in the sidebar's
About box (`public/index.html`); keep it and this file in step.

## 1.2.0 — 2026-10-18

- French (Français), translated as far as the Chinese: the sidebar, map
  controls, buttons, menus and login screen. Pick it under Language, or it's
  chosen for you when your browser prefers French over English.

## 1.1.0 — 2026-10-18

- Simplified Chinese (中文). feets picks it when your browser prefers Chinese,
  and there's a Language picker in Account and on the login screen. The
  sidebar, map controls, buttons, menus and login screen are translated;
  messages, stats, trophies, quests and the help pages are still English.
- Translations live in `public/lang/` (see `public/i18n.js` for how to add
  phrases or another language).

## 1.0.0 — 2026-10-18

The first numbered version. Everything feets does so far, including:

- Tracks from GPX files and Strava (with automatic import), on an
  OpenStreetMap map, with filters, stats, goals, weekly quests, trophies and
  segments.
- Map modes: tracks, heatmap, fog of war (with fog that grows back, and small
  patches of fog shut in by clearings cleared too), street coverage and route
  planning.
- Street maps for the places you run, found and added in the background, and
  sooner for new accounts in their first couple of hours.
- Route planning with loops, ghost races, and GPS art: built-in shapes, your
  own shapes from SVG files, and a Loose ↔ Strict setting for how closely the
  route follows the shape.
- Accounts, invitations, view-only accounts and view links.
